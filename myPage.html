                        First off I'd like to thank you for taking the time to stop by. My name is Jeff, and site is for you to get a chance to get to know me. It is also a chance for me to showcase some of the skill I've learned over time.<br><br> In 2001 a 19 year old boy decided to raise his hand and enlist into the United States Army. During my time I worked as a Diesel Mechanic, a Shop Foreman, and a Maintenance Supervisor who was responsible for over 8 million dollars worth of equipment. I also had the pleasure of being a Recruiter for the Army. I learned a great many things about life, responsibility, accountability, and the importance of a great work ethic.<br><br> How did I get here, well glad you asked. In February 2021 I retired from the Army after 20 years. It was a blessing, but also a time of transformation. Part of my transformation was to go to a career accelerator and start my next journey. I attended Codeup for Full Stack Web Development and have loved it ever since I started the pre-work. Once I finish my hope is to use a combination of all the talents I've learned to provide a professionally design website for you.
